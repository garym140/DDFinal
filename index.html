Foucault introduces the psychological effects of such a structure. This element seemed the most fascinating to me! There is a power transfer that occurs, within the structure. If you are subject to being watched 24/7, then you feel the eyes of those watching you at all times. As a prisoner within a cell, your visibility is isolated. This feeling alone can exaggerate the feeling of being observed, causing the subject to internalize that feeling to the point that he becomes his own overseer. Which is worst? Having someone observe you 24/7 or you unknowingly becoming the overseer? In general who should be entrusted with this power to observe?';
